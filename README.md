# Mercury Pose Estimation Service 🏃

A REST server which processes image requests with [PoseNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet),
 and it replies with keypoints detected.

### 🔧 Installation

We recommend using the command-line utility npm to install the dependencies listed in 
the package.json file. You can install the dependencies running:

``
npm install
``

The server starts listening by default in port defined by the environment variable PORT. 
If no environment variable is set up then the server starts listening on port 3000. 
You can change this parameter in the file [bin/www.js](bin/www.js). 

### 📦 Deploying

We use the [**Express**](https://expressjs.com/) framework for the development of the 
REST server in Node.js. To start the services you can run:

``
node bin/www
``

The server will start listening for requests and all services will be ready.
It will also set up TensorFlow.
